I stared into my coffee pot

I stared into the open coffee pot on the stove, For a brief moment, there were these beautiful swirls of foam that looked like they belonged in a magazine piece, Links fired in my head from mythical steel works, the burguoeis book-cafes. I thought about getting a camera from the money I have coddled up, A small camera, So that people don’t see me take a photo and call me a photographer, My father would mock me for being anything at all. 

My will to live is embroiled in the act of hiding myself, I grew up wanting to hide and emerge as a perfect statue of my ambition, to work alone, secretively, and emerge a perfect being. I can’t stand the idea of my imperfect self, I can’t stand being mediocre, because being special was the only way to weather my way through home.

I write at night, I think at night, when the world goes quiet and a purple app won’t haunt me me with its pinging. I work at night because I feel free enough to write, think and idealise, I feel free to be myself when the judges of the world are far far away.
